<br><br>
I am a high school student currently taking an entrance seminar for the Computer Information Systems program at the National Technological University (UTN). I possess skills in HTML, a strong understanding of CSS, and basic experience in JavaScript.

Recently, I applied my knowledge in a personal project for a family member by creating a website for "Goddesses & Sorceresses." Although this project is currently inactive, it allowed me to practice my web design skills and gain a better understanding of the website development process from the ground up.

I am committed to my education and excited to learn more about web development and programming. My goal is to contribute to collaborative projects, as I believe this experience will provide me with the opportunity to continue growing in this fascinating field and enhance my future prospects.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I am open to connecting with other developers to exchange ideas and knowledge.
